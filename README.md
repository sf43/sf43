- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sf43
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in small / personal hobby projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Finnish
- ğŸ¦‰ I use Github for maintaining a notes database, which is not a public repository. So not much to see in my profile.

<!---
sf43/sf43 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
